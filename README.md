# AIM
In this work 17 years of historical data was leveraged to estimate genetic trends and also formulate the breeding panel as a future breeding resource.  The Manucript entitled "Genetic Trends Estimation in IRRIs Rice Drought Breeding Program and Identification of High Yielding Drought Tolerant Lines" is available as a pre-print at [Link will be updated soon]().
